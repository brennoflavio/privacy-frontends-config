# Privacy Frontend Config Files

This repository contains docker-compose files for a lot of privacy frontends that I used to self host.

Since I turned off my home server, I'm making those configurations public if someone wants to get started.

Please notice that this repository is likely to be outdated and should be used only as a starting point.
